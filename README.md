  <summary>How do I build an airship in SkyJourney?</summary>

🎈 Building an airship in *SkyJourney* is an exciting process!

The modpack uses [**Eureka! Ships! for Valkyrien Skies**](https://modrinth.com/mod/eureka).

To get started, you’ll need to use specific blocks like the [Ship’s Helm](https://github.com/ValkyrienSkies/Eureka/wiki/Blocks#ships-helm) and [Balloon Blocks](https://github.com/ValkyrienSkies/Eureka/wiki/Blocks#balloon).  

For a detailed step-by-step guide, including the purpose and function of each block, please refer to the official Eureka Wiki here:
